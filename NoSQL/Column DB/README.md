## Cassandra supports multiple data models to cater to various use cases. Here are some of the most common data models in Cassandra:

#### Column-Family Data Model:-

##### This is the traditional data model in Cassandra. Data is organized into column families (tables), rows (keys), and columns within each row. Well-suited for time-series data or data with varying attributes.

#### Wide-Column Data Model:-

##### An extension of the column-family data model. Each row can have a varying number of columns, and columns are grouped into column families. Allows for efficient querying of specific columns and is often used in time-series data and sensor data.

#### Document Data Model:-

##### Introduced in Cassandra 2.0 and improved in later versions. Data is organized as collections of documents. Each document can have a different structure and schema. Suitable for storing JSON-like data and provides flexible schema support.

#### Graph Data Model:-

##### Graph databases in Cassandra, such as DSE Graph, allow the storage and retrieval of graph-based data. Data is organized into vertices (nodes) and edges. Ideal for use cases involving relationships, social networks, and complex graph-based data structures.

#### Time-Series Data Model:-

##### Specialized data model for time-series data, such as sensor data, logs, and events. Data is indexed and queried based on timestamps. Optimized for handling high write and read throughput of time-series data.

##### Materialized View Data Model:-

#### Cassandra supports materialized views, which allow you to create precomputed views of data to simplify querying. This model is helpful when you need to query data in various ways without complex and costly joins.

##### Relational Data Model (CQL):-

#### Cassandra Query Language (CQL) allows you to model data in a way that resembles traditional relational databases. While it maintains CQL's benefits, it still adheres to Cassandra's distributed architecture.

##### Hierarchical Data Model:-

#### This model allows you to represent hierarchical data structures like directories and file systems. Ideal for managing and querying hierarchical data efficiently.

##### Key-Value Data Model:-

#### Though not the primary focus of Cassandra, it can be used as a distributed key-value store where the value is often a binary blob. Typically used when simple, fast key-based access is required.

##### Geospatial Data Model:-

#### Cassandra's support for geospatial data modeling allows storing and querying geographic information. Useful for location-based applications and services.
