## Cassandra supports multiple data models to cater to various use cases. Here are some of the most common data models in Cassandra:

#### Column-Family Data Model:-

##### This is the traditional data model in Cassandra. Data is organized into column families (tables), rows (keys), and columns within each row. Well-suited for time-series data or data with varying attributes.

#### Wide-Column Data Model:-

##### An extension of the column-family data model. Each row can have a varying number of columns, and columns are grouped into column families. Allows for efficient querying of specific columns and is often used in time-series data and sensor data.
