## Cassandra supports multiple data models to cater to various use cases. Here are some of the most common data models in Cassandra:

#### Column-Family Data Model:-

##### This is the traditional data model in Cassandra. Data is organized into column families (tables), rows (keys), and columns within each row. Well-suited for time-series data or data with varying attributes.

#### Wide-Column Data Model:-

##### An extension of the column-family data model. Each row can have a varying number of columns, and columns are grouped into column families. Allows for efficient querying of specific columns and is often used in time-series data and sensor data.

#### Document Data Model:-

##### Introduced in Cassandra 2.0 and improved in later versions. Data is organized as collections of documents. Each document can have a different structure and schema. Suitable for storing JSON-like data and provides flexible schema support.

#### Graph Data Model:-

##### Graph databases in Cassandra, such as DSE Graph, allow the storage and retrieval of graph-based data. Data is organized into vertices (nodes) and edges. Ideal for use cases involving relationships, social networks, and complex graph-based data structures.
